{: .question .long #interview-start}
Talk about the decision to start Paladin. How did you decide to take on the challenge of social impact? What did you consider when choosing whether to become a for-profit or non-profit company?   

I love the concept of social enterprises because they’re focused on changing the world and becoming self-sustaining at the same time. Paladin was the perfect intersection of my personal and professional experiences. I studied politics and Latin American Studies at school, becoming fixated on the role law and policy play in shaping people’s lives. Upon graduating, I joined the Department of Justice doing international criminal work, which helped me understand the complexities of the judicial system and the power of diplomacy. As a founding team member of Grouper, an NYC-based startup,  I learned how to use tech to scale networks. At Paladin, I combine those two loves for technology and social justice to scale access to legal services in an unprecedented way. When we started Paladin, we decided to incorporate as a B-Corp (benefit corporation) to emphasize our commitment to social impact.

From the DoJ to Grouper to Entrepreneurship, your impressive career has been eclectic but with a clear emphasis on helping people. What principles have guided you?

My main guiding principles are always: how can I learn the most, how can I create the most value, and how can I empower others? You learn something new at every job, and that’s particularly true about startups since you’re moving so quickly and learning by doing. My work style tends to be experiential, so I’m constantly trying to find creative solutions to old problems. Lastly, as a first-generation college graduate and Latina entrepreneur, empowering others is a personal mission of mine. I’m always looking for ways to give back.

During your time at the DoJ, you faced the decision of whether or not to go to law school. What led you to ultimately pursue a path in the private sector?

I learned quickly at the Department of Justice how bureaucracy can constrain innovation, and how important it was to move quickly. While I loved the idea of law school, for me, that time and money seemed better spent gaining hands-on experience that I could then apply to a global problem. I do think about going back to night law school to pick up a few of these great pro bono cases myself-- one day!

{: .question .short}
What is your style of femininity (or masculinity, if you prefer)?

My style of femininity definitely has an element of fuego, as my friends call it. Fuego to me is a combination of passion, grit, and determination that makes you unstoppable.

{: .question .short}
What’s missing from the conversation around feminism?

Speaking as a woman in business, I’d like to see the conversation change from ‘what’s it like to be a woman in X industry’ to ‘how are women shaping X industry’. It’s much more powerful to focus on women’s contributions and impact than to focus on the negative.

{: .question .short}
We believe the members of Lady Mafia are the movers, the shakers. What is your contribution, what do you want to be remembered as?

My legacy will be the people I impact, whether personally, through Paladin, or through future endeavors. The most important thing to me is paying it forward and supporting others.

{: .question .short}
Who is inspiring you right now? Who do you think is part of Lady Mafia?  

Especially coming off of the election, I think we’re encountering an unprecedented time for Lady Mafiosas to emerge and flourish, which is really exciting. I’ve recently been inspired by the young women I mentor, who are coming into their own as entrepreneurs and leaders. It’s humbling and thrilling to be a part of their journeys!

{: .question .short}
What’s next for you?

This year, my goals are to launch Paladin across the country, expand internationally, and move into industries outside of law to offer access to professional services more generally.
