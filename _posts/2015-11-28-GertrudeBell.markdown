quote: No woman in recent time has combined her qualities – her taste for arduous and dangerous adventure with her scientific interest and knowledge, her competence in archaeology and art, her distinguished literary gift, her sympathy for all sorts and condition of men, her political insight and appreciation of human values, her masculine vigour, hard common sense and practical efficiency – all tempered by feminine charm and a most romantic spirit.  -- D. G. Hogarth

datingprofile: true
nameage: Gertrude Margaret Lowthian Bell, 147
location: Baghdad, Iraq
employer: Works at British Military Intelligence, self-employed archeologist in Syria, or the Arab Bureau, depending, depending on the day.
education: Oxford (first chick awarded highest honors in Modern History)
interested: Men (preferably those who speak one of the eight languages I am fluent in including French, German, Persian, Arabic and Turkish. But I’m great at teaching myself language, so it shouldn’t be a problem.
firstdate: playing tennis or taking a stroll through the Baghdad Museum of Antiquities, which I created.
bio: 5'5. People call me "al-Khatun" (Lady of the Court). When I’m not busy creating British colonial policy, I like long, solo, 1500 mile, walks through the desert, climbing mountains in the Swiss Alps, and getting to know Arab tribal leaders. I’m super into archeology and have funded my own archeological digs throughout the middle-east, because the archeological societies won’t let a woman in! I’m passionate, caring, and a little shy, but definitely have a taste for luxury...even when traveling across the desert I must have my china dinner service and a formal dinner dress with me! Also, I may or may not be a spy.

In the spirit of Thanksgiving (with it's historical context of exploration and unfortunately colonialization), we want to highlight one of the many fearless explorers who helped map uncharted lands. We thought it fitting to profile the person who embodies the contrast between the typical scene of stuffed, turkey-sedated, tipsy Americans at a Thanksgiving gathering and the violent events happening currently in the Middle East.

literally put Iraq and Syria on the map.

-driven by heartbreak
-mountaineering, archaeology, mapping Syria ("Bell Maps")
-world War 1 policy
-middle east strategy
when we hear about Iraq and Syria, we are experiencing Gertrude's living legacy.  Take a moment to think of Bell and the other women and men who are are part of Lady Mafia - left out of history books but oh so relevant.

**Don't worry, we know you didn't sleep through class:**

You should have learned about Gertrude Bell in any history class that covered influential explorers, WWI, the Victorian era, and definitely any current events lessons. Um, hello, she created Iraq and literally drew Syria, so yeah, she's probably pretty relevant.

**Gertrude Bell’s List of Firsts**

* The first woman to receive a first-class degree, the highest honors in Modern History at Oxford 1886.
* The first person to climb all the peaks of the Engelhörner range in the Swiss Alps, one of which is named after her: “Gertrude’s Peak.” 1904
* The first woman to do a solo journey into the uncharted Arabian desert (she traveled by camel for 1500 miles across Central Arabia in 1914 and received the gold Founder’s Medal from the Royal Geographic Society)
* Created the first comprehensive map of Syria and other areas of the Middle East.
* First female officer (known as “Major Miss Bell”) ever to be employed by British military intelligence and named Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire.
* Orchestrated the first government in Iraq.
* Published the first white paper to written by woman: *Review of the Civil Administration of Mesopotamia* in 1920.
* Miss Bell’s life and legacy was also the subject of an international scholarly conference last year in London, the first of its kind.

Are you in love yet? We are. Luckily, she's single (as of her death in 1926)!
