quote: No woman in recent time has combined her qualities – her taste for arduous and dangerous adventure with her scientific interest and knowledge, her competence in archaeology and art, her distinguished literary gift, her sympathy for all sorts and condition of men, her political insight and appreciation of human values, her masculine vigour, hard common sense and practical efficiency – all tempered by feminine charm and a most romantic spirit.  -- D. G. Hogarth

nameage: Gertrude Margaret Lowthian Bell
birthday: July 14, 1868
location: Baghdad, Iraq
origin: Great Britain
employer: Works at British Military Intelligence, self-employed archeologist in Syria, or the Arab Bureau, depending on the day.
education: Oxford (first chick awarded highest honors in Modern History)
interested: Men (bonus if you speak one of the eight languages I am fluent in including French, German, Persian, Arabic and Turkish. But I’m great at teaching myself language, so it shouldn’t be a problem.
firstdate: playing tennis or taking a stroll through the Baghdad Museum of Antiquities, which I founded.
bio: 5'5. People call me "al-Khatun" (Lady of the Court). When I’m not busy creating British colonial policy, I like long, solo, 1500-mile treks through the desert, climbing mountains in the Swiss Alps, and getting to know Arab tribal leaders. I’m super into archeology and have funded my own archeological digs throughout the middle-east, because the archeological societies won’t let a woman in (silly Victorian rules)! I’m passionate, caring, and a little shy, but definitely have a taste for luxury...even when traveling across the desert I must have my china dinner service and a formal dinner dress with me! Also, I may or may not be a spy.

It's impossible to argue - she is incredible. Gertrude once spent 53 hours at the end of a rope in the Alps after her climbing expedition was caught in a blizzard. Are you in love yet? We sure are. Luckily, she's single (as of her suspected suicide in 1926)!  #swiperight

Millennial dating quips aside, in the spirit of Thanksgiving (with it's historical context of exploration and unfortunately colonization), we want to highlight one of the many fearless explorers who helped map uncharted lands. We thought it fitting to profile the person who embodies the contrast between the typical scene of stuffed, turkey-sedated, tipsy Americans at a Thanksgiving gathering and the violent events happening currently in the Middle East.

As the first female British intelligence Officer and adviser on Arabian affairs to the British government, Bell helped shape the geopolitical map of the world as it changed dramatically after World War I - she literally put Iraq and Syria on the map. She explored and documented much of Arabia (often by herself), creating the maps of Syria used in the World Wars known as the "Bell Maps."

Bell was instrumental in post-WWI policy in the middle East, and fought for Iraqi unification. Many in the Western world know of her colleague T.E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia), and while her name is almost unknown in Britain and the English-speaking world, it is spoken with reverence and gratitude by many in the middle East.

>Saad Eskander, director of Iraq’s national library and archives, referred to Lawrence’s fame in the Middle East and then said, “But in Iraq, it is only Gertrude Bell who occupies an exceptional place both in the imagination of its ordinary people and in the mind of its cultural and political elites."

Bell had a unique style of diplomacy that gained the respect of leaders of various tribes throughout the Middle East, not to mention Winston Churchill. She spent time understanding each culture, which made her so skilled as a liaison. Did we mention this all happened during a time where exposed wrists were scandalous?! Hard to believe a woman could Climb the swiss Alps, let alone be the trusted advisor of Europe's Prime Ministers and Mesopotamia's Prince's alike.

While her dreams of a unified Iraq have crumbled (arguably because nobody since has displayed her level of tact and empathy), when we hear about Iraq and Syria, we are experiencing Gertrude's living legacy.  Take a moment to think of Bell and the other women and men who are are part of Lady Mafia - left out of history books but oh so relevant.

**Don't worry, we know you didn't sleep through class:**

You should have learned about Gertrude Bell in any history class that covered influential explorers, WWI, the Victorian era, and definitely any current events lessons. Um, hello, she created Iraq and literally drew Syria, so yeah, she's probably pretty relevant.
