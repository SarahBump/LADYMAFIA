### Selfie addicts of the world, you are welcome.

**What she's known for:**

Her career on the silver screen that earned her the title of Most Beautiful Woman in the World.

**Why you should know her, and why she is definitely a member of the mafia:**

She basically invented wifi. Hedy used her knowledge of torpedos (yes, torpedos) to help develop a frequency-hopping technology to thwart German U-Boats during World War II that served as the basis for wifi technology that lets us send our beloved selfies across the world with the click of a button.

**She is definitely not basic:**

She was the first actress to portray a sex scene involving female pleasure on film.

**Don't worry, we know you didn't sleep through class:**

Your history classes probably forgot cover Hedy's contribution in any World War II unit. If you learned about frequency and sound waves in physics (you did, but that is one you may have slept through), Hedy should have been mentioned.
