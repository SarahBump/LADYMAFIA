quote: We aren’t documenting “women engineers,” or “female leaders,” or “girls-who-xyz.” We simply intend to create a catalogue of the awesome ways that humans around us - many who happen to be women - inspire us in their everyday actions. Whether subtle or bold, they are fierce. They are agents of change. They are the LADY MAFIA.

### Why did we decide to create this site?
shouldn't be learning about people who made history from google doodle, led to believe women's history is a footnote, people who are impacting our lives, whether contemporary or historical, should be acknowledge for their contributions regardless of who they are. If anything the adversity that women have faced almost warrants more recognition.
