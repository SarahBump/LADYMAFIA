quote: No woman in recent time has combined her qualities – her taste for arduous and dangerous adventure with her scientific interest and knowledge, her competence in archaeology and art, her distinguished literary gift, her sympathy for all sorts and condition of men, her political insight and appreciation of human values, her masculine vigour, hard common sense and practical efficiency – all tempered by feminine charm and a most romantic spirit.  -- D. G. Hogarth

type: profile
datingprofile: true
nameage: Gertrude Margaret Lowthian Bell, 147
location: Baghdad, Iraq
employer: Works at British Military Intelligence, self-employed archeologist in Syria, or the Arab Bureau, depending, depending on the day.
education: Oxford (first chick awarded highest honors in Modern History)
interested: Interested in -  Men (preferably those who speak one of the eight languages I am fluent in including French, German, Persian, Arabic and Turkish. But I’m great at teaching myself language, so it shouldn’t be a problem.
firstdate: playing tennis or taking a stroll through the Baghdad Museum of Antiquities, which I created.
bio: 5'5. People call me "al-Khatun" (Lady of the Court). When I’m not busy creating British colonial policy, I like long, solo, 1500 mile, walks through the desert, climbing mountains in the Swiss Alps, and getting to know Arab tribal leaders. I’m super into archeology and have funded my own archeological digs throughout the middle-east, because the archeological societies won’t let a woman in! I’m passionate, caring, and a little shy, but definitely have a taste for luxury...even when traveling across the desert I must have my china dinner service and a formal dinner dress with me! Also, I may or may not be a spy.

In the spirit of Thanksgiving (with it's historical context of exploration and unfortunately colonialization), we want to highlight one of the many fearless explorers who helped map uncharted lands. Like the contrast between the typical scene of stuffed, turkey-sedated, tipsy Americans at a Thanksgiving gathering and the violent events happening currently in the Middle East, we thought it fitting to profile the person who represents that juxtoposition.

literally put Iraq and Syria on the map.

-driven by heartbreak
-mountaineering, archaeology, mapping Syria ("Bell Maps")
-world War 1 policy
-middle east strategy
-suicide

when we hear about Iraq and Syria, we are experiencing Gertrude's living legacy.  Take a moment to think of Bell and the other women and men who are are part of Lady Mafia - left out of history books but oh so relevant.

**Don't worry, we know you didn't sleep through class:**

You should have learned about Gertrude Bell in any history class that covered influential explorers, WWI, the Victorian era, and definitely any current events lessons. Um, hello, she created Iraq and literally drew Syria, so yeah, she's probably pretty relevant.
