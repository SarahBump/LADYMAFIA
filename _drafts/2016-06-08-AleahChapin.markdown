What is your style of femininity?

Although I feel very comfortable being a woman, I don’t think I define my personality purely by gender. I love being active and using my body and accomplishing projects that seem difficult or impossible. I had a motorcycle in my first year of college and loved the power it gave me, but switched to a bicycle not long after and have never gone back. I love making things with my hands, whether that’s building, baking, cobbling shoes or sewing clothing. So I think my style of femininity is “do what you love”.

What’s missing from the conversation around feminism?
I’m not sure if it’s missing, as it is something I talk about with friends all the time. I believe that we, as women, should really be able to do whatever 	we want without that confirming nor denying our female identities. We should be able to have any job, wear any clothing, do any activity. We should 	be able to have a family and a career without being told we have to choose between the two. We should be able to make our own lives based on what we love and what we want, not on what has come before us.

We believe the members of Lady Mafia are the movers, the shakers. What is your contribution, what do you want to be remembered as?
I hope my work is remembered. I hope that it can make a difference in how we see our own bodies, how we define beauty and strength, courage and vulnerability. I hope my paintings can help us see the humanity in each other.
…

Who is inspiring you right now? Who do you think is part of Lady Mafia?  
My friends are inspiring me. They are mothers and partners, photographers, painters, doulas, scientists and writers. They are strong, powerful, beautiful women that are doing what they want to do.
