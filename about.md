### Why lady mafia?
Violence and drug connotations aside, when you think of the word mafia you might associate it with a sense of mystique, an ubiquitous but unseen force, an invisible network of individuals, a powerful whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. A formal definition is hard to come by, as elusive as a mafia itself. Generally defined, a mafia is a closed group of people in a particular field, having a controlling influence.

The powerful force of femininity and of women in general is intangible but real. If Helen of Troy precipitated the Trojan war without so much as raising a finger, enough said.

The media has recently focused lots of attention on women, “women’s issues,” women in the work force, the deficit of women in tech fields, and almost glorifying women who have outstanding impact (you know, “for a girl”). The truth is, women have been rocking out for centuries. For one reason or another, they have been largely left out of history books, save for the token Marie Curies of each epoch that somehow make it in as the exception.

Women’s contributions have gone so undocumented and unnoticed that we are now supposed to believe that the days of great accomplishments by women represent a new chapter for humanity. Not so. Women have been the force behind scientific discoveries, the visionaries of art, the pioneers of literature, the first computer programmers, forensic scientists, and leaders of empires. They have been mothers and wives and spouses and friends and activists and even tyrants.

But the invisible, potent, and largely non-accredited impact they have had, even in the shadows, has a mafia-like quality that we want to celebrate. In the age of information, we think it’s important to document the contributions of people who we are deeming members of the Lady Mafia: women and men who are making the world better, who are doing courageous things in the name of human flourishing, who embody the spirit of the invisible force of femininity that has upheld the virtue of humanity even in the darkest days of history.

We aren’t documenting “women engineers,” or “female leaders,” or “girls-who-xyz.” We simply intend to create a catalogue of the awesome ways that humans around us - many who happen to be women - inspire us in their everyday actions. Whether subtle or bold, they are fierce. They are agents of change. They are the Lady Mafia.
