###Development
LadyMafia.Rocks was built by two full-stack developers, <a href="http://www.mightygaby.com/" target="_blank"> Gaby Ruiz-Funes</a> and <a href="http://www.sarahbump.com/" target="_blank" > Sarah Bump</a>. <br>
The site is built with Jekyll, which is written in Ruby. <br>
The CSS was written with both SASS and Handlebars. <br>
It is being served by Github Pages, you can view the <a href="https://github.com/SarahBump/LADYMAFIA" target="_blank" > Github repository here</a>.


###Design
The site was deigned by Gaby Ruiz-Funes and Sarah Bump.<br>
The site's icons were built in Adobe Illustrator by Gaby Ruiz-Funes, unless otherwise noted.<br>
There is no use of pictures on the, the only time you see pictures of the Mafia is a mug shot.<br>
The individual colors for each post represent the spirit of that post.<br>
The name of the font is ***** we appreciated the block style, as it gives a news-like feel,<br> a sense of importance and urgency.<br>
The logo was designed to look like she is either wearing a hoodie or it is her hair,<br> left it up to the interpretation of the viewer.<br>
Overall, the site is aiming to stay minimalist in order to play up the elusiveness that is a mafia.
